# Contributing to rTeenDeveloper/Slack-Discord Bridge

Thank you for taking time to contribute to our Community and most importantly our project. We value every contribution and it means a lot for us. If you haven't joined our Slack please do, you can find more information in our [TeenDeveloper Slack repo](https://github.com/rTeenDeveloper/TeenDeveloperSlack).

Please remember to read the following guide to learn more about how we care to make our repos look clean.

# Style

 * Start comments with a Uppercase letter.
 * Document your code! Seriously, how else are we supposed to know what are you doing?

# Branch naming

  * For feature branches - feat/issuenumber-branch-name
  * For bugfixes - bug/issuenumber
  * For chores (updating dependencies, etc...) - chore/issuenumber-update-dependencies, for example

# Commit naming

   * First of all - a pull request to a bugfix should consist of one commit. Nobody likes thousands of commits, which actually worsen repo view and make navigating commits a lot harder. Use `git commit --amend, git push --force`
   * Start a commit with issue#. Example: #123: Fixes incorrect naming of variable
   * No pointless commit messages.
   * First line of the commit - 80 chars
   * You may also post the extended commit message. First a short line, then an empty line, then your extended commit message


Have fun and enjoy hacking!
